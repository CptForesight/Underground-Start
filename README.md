# Underground-Start
Underground Start modification for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead
Welcome! If you have stumbled across this README, then you have found my humble little mod to add a starting scenario and underground, subway themed structures, giving you an option to be a subterrain dweller. It is currently a work in progress, with most changes taking place locally as I test new ideas, such as nesting. Once I am happy with the overall state of it, any further edits will be pushed through here.
